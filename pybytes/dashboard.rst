Visualise data from your device
===============================

In this section, we will explain to you how to create widgets for data
visualisation and set up your device’s dashboard on Pybytes.

{% hint style=“info” %} We assume that you already have your device
connected to Pybytes. In case you haven’t, check how to `add your device
here <connect/>`__. After your done with that, you can proceed to the
next example. {% endhint %}

Step 1: Set up your application (``main.py``)
---------------------------------------------

The first step is to have an application running on your device. The
application in this example sends data from a vector every 10 seconds to
Pybytes.

1. Open the ``main.py`` file on Pymakr;
2. Insert the following code on your ``main.py``;

.. code:: python

   # Import what is necessary to create a thread
   import _thread
   from time import sleep

   # Increment index used to scan each point from vector sensors_data
   def inc(index, vector):
       if index < len(vector)-1:
           return index+1
       else:
           return 0

   # Define your thread's behaviour, here it's a loop sending sensors data every 10 seconds
   def send_env_data():
       idx = 0
       sensors_data = [0, -0.2, -0.5, -0.7, -0.8, -0.9, -0.9, -0.9, -0.8, -0.6, -0.4, -0.2, 0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.9, 0.9, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.1]

       while (pybytes):
           pybytes.send_virtual_pin_value(False, 1, sensors_data[idx])
           idx = inc(idx, sensors_data)
           sleep(10)

   # Start your thread
   _thread.start_new_thread(send_env_data, ())

3. Upload the code into your device. Now your device is sending data to
   Pybytes.

{% hint style=“info” %} In this code, we’re calling the function
``pybytes.send_virtual_pin_value(persistent, pin, value))`` to
communicate with Pybytes. This function is part of the Pybytes library,
and it has three arguments: ``persistent``, ``pin`` and ``value``.

-  ``persistent`` denotes information that is infrequently accessed and
   not likely to be modified;
-  ``pin`` represents which virtual pin is receiving data;
-  ``value`` is the value being attributed to that particular pin {%
   endhint %}

Step 2: Add a signal from your device
-------------------------------------

Go to Pybytes.

1. On ``Devices`` page select a device;

|image0|

2. On your device’s page click on ``Data`` tab.

|image1|

3. Click on the ``Define New Signal`` button.

|image2|

4. Define the new signal by entering a number, a name, a data type and a
   unit. Finally, click on the button ``Define``.

|image3|

5. Your signal was added!

|image4|

{% hint style=“info” %} The name and unit are labels used to identify
your signal inside Pybytes (In this example we defined ``Sinwave`` as
the name of the signal and ``Rad`` as the unit).

The signal number has to match the pin number that you defined on
``pybytes.send_virtual_pin_value`` function call, inside your
``main.py`` code (In this example we defined ``pin = 1``);

The datatype also has to match the variable used as argument on
``pybytes.send_virtual_pin_value`` function call, inside your
``main.py`` code (In this example our variable is a floating number;
therefore we defined as a ``Float32``). {% endhint %}

Step 3: Add a widget for the signal
-----------------------------------

1. Click on the signal card.

|image5|

2. Click on the button ``Create a new display``.

|image6|

3. Select the type of visualisation (e.g. Bar chart or Line chart).

|image7|

4. You can adjust the parameters of your widget at ``Settings``. After,
   click on the button ``Create``.

|image8|

5. Your widget was created. Now, add your widget to your device’s
   dashboard. Click on the button ``Edit`` on your widget.

|image9|

6. Mark the checkbox ``Display on Dashboard`` at ``Settings``. Finally,
   click on the button ``Save``.

|image10|

7. Click on the tab ``Dashboard``. Your widget was successfully added
   there!

|image11|

Step 4: Organise your dashboard
-------------------------------

1. Click on the button ``Organise``. Now the dashboard’s grid will enter
   the edit mode and allow you to resize and reposition its widgets.

|image12|

2. Resize a widget by clicking on the triangle icon at the bottom right
   corner of the widget and drag the cursor over the grid. After, click
   on the button ``Save`` to save this action.

|image13|

3. Change the widget’s position by drag-and-dropping it over the grid.
   After, click on the button ``Save`` to save this action.

|image14|

Done!
-----

Now you’ve learned how to set up your device’s dashboard to display
data. Also, you can add more widgets to other pins of your device.
