1.1.1 LoPy
==========

Basic connection
----------------

{% tabs %} {% tab title=“Exp Board 2.0” %} \* Look for the reset button
on the module (located at a corner of the board, next to the LED). \*
Locate the USB connector on the expansion board. \* Insert the LoPy
module on the the expansion board with the reset button pointing towards
the USB connector. It should firmly click into place and the pins should
now no longer be visible.

|image0| {% endtab %}

{% tab title=“Exp Board 3.0” %} \* Before connecting your module to an
Expansion Board 3.0, you should update the firmware on the Expansion
Board 3.0. Instructions on how to do this can be found
`here <https://docs.pycom.io/pytrackpysense/installation/firmware.html>`__.
\* Look for the reset button on the module (located at a corner of the
board, next to the LED). \* Locate the USB connector on the expansion
board. \* Insert the LoPy module on the Expansion Board with the reset
button pointing towards the USB connector. It should firmly click into
place and the pins should now no longer be visible.

{% tab title=“Pytrack/Pysense/Pyscan” %} \* Before connecting your
module to a Pysense/Pytrack/Pyscan board, you should update the firmware
on the Pysense/Pytrack/Pyscan. Instructions on how to do this can be
found
`here <https://docs.pycom.io/pytrackpysense/installation/firmware.html>`__.
\* Look for the reset button on the LoPy module (located at a corner of
the board, next to the LED). \* Locate the USB connector on the
Pysense/Pytrack/Pyscan. \* Insert the module on the
Pysense/Pytrack/Pyscan with the reset button pointing towards the USB
connector. It should firmly click into place and the pins should now no
longer be visible.

{% tab title=“USB UART Adapter” %} \* Firstly you will need to connect
power to your LoPy. You will need to supply ``3.5v``-``5.5v`` to the
``Vin`` pin.

{% hint style=“danger” %} Do *not* feed ``3.3v`` directly to the
``3.3v`` supply pin, this will damage the regulator. {% endhint %}

-  The connect the ``RX`` and ``TX`` of your USB UART to the ``TX`` and
   ``RX`` of the LoPy respectively.

{% hint style=“warning” %} Please ensure you have the signal level of
the UART adapter set to ``3.3v`` before connecting it. {% endhint %}

-  In order to put the LoPy into bootloader mode to update the device
   firmware you will need to connect ``P2`` to ``GND``. We recommend you
   connect a button between the two to make this simpler.

|image4| {% endtab %}

{% tab title=“WiFi” %} **Note:** This method of connection is not
recommended for first time users. It is possible to lock yourself out of
the device, requiring a USB connection.

-  In order to access the LoPy via WiFi you only need to provide
   ``3.5v`` - ``5.5v`` on the ``Vin`` pin of the LoPy:

|image5|

-  By default, when the LoPy boots, it will create a WiFi access point
   with the following credentials:

   -  SSID: ``lopy-wlan``
   -  password: ``www.pycom.io``

-  Once connected to this network you will be able to access the telnet
   and FTP servers running on the LoPy. For both of these the login
   details are:

   -  username: ``micro``
   -  password: ``python`` {% endtab %} {% endtabs %}

Antennas
--------

Lora
~~~~

{% hint style=“danger” %} If you intend on using the LoRa connectivity
of the LoPy you **must** connect a LoRa antenna to your LoPy before
trying to use LoRa otherwise you risk damaging the device. {% endhint %}

{% hint style=“danger” %} The LoPy only supports LoRa on the 868MHz or
915MHz bands. It does not support 433MHz. For this you will require a
LoPy4. {% endhint %}

-  Firstly you will need to connect the U.FL to SMA pig tail to the LoPy
   using the U.FL connector on the same side of the LoPy as the LED.

|image6|

-  If you are using a pycase, you will next need to put the SMA
   connector through the antenna hole, ensuring you align the flat edge
   correctly, and screw down the connector using the provided nut.
-  Finally you will need to screw on the antenna to the SMA connector.

WiFi/Bluetooth (optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All Pycom modules, including the LoPy, come with a on-board WiFi antenna
as well as a U.FL connector for an external antenna. The external
antenna is optional and only required if you need better performance or
are mounting the LoPy in such a way that the WiFi signal is blocked.
Switching between the antennas is done via software, instructions for
this can be found
`here. <https://docs.pycom.io/chapter/firmwareapi/pycom/network/wlan.html>`__

Deep Sleep current issue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The LoPy, SiPy, and WiPy 2.0 experience an issue where the modules
maintain a high current consumption in deep sleep mode. This issue has
been resolved in all newer products. The cause for this issue is the DC
to DC switch mode converter remains in a high performance mode even when
the device is in deep sleep. The flash memory chip also does not power
down. A more detailed explanation can be found
`here. <https://forum.pycom.io/topic/1022/root-causes-of-high-deep-sleep-current>`__
