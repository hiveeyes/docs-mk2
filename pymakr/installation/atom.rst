Atom text editor users, we recommend the **Pymakr Plugin for Atom**.
This section will help you get started using the Atom Text Editor &
Pymakr Plugin.

Connecting via Serial USB
-------------------------

After installing the Pymakr Plugin, you need to take a few seconds to
configure it for first time use. Please follow these steps:

1. Connect your Pycom device to your computer via USB. If you are using
   an Expansion Board 2.0, and have just finished a firmware upgrade, be
   sure to **remove the wire between GND and G23** and reset your device
   by pressing the button.

   Note: you don’t need the wire for Expansion Board 3.0

2. Open Atom and ensure that the Pymakr Plugin has correctly installed.

3. Open the Pymakr console by clicking the ``^`` button, located in the
   lower right side of the Atom window.

4. Click, ``More`` followed by ``Get Serial Ports``. This will copy the
   serial address of your expansion board to your clipboard.

5. Navigate to ``Settings > Global Settings``

|image8|

6. Paste the serial address you copied earlier into the text field
   ``Device Address``

|image9|

7. Press connect and the Pymakr console should show three arrows
   ``>>>``, indicating that you are connected

|image10|

These settings can also be applied on a per project basis by clicking
``Settings`` then ``Project Settings``. This will open a JSON file which
you can edit to enter your desired settings.

{% hint style=“info” %} This process is easiest with either a Pycom
Expansion Board or a Pytrack/Pysense as the addresses are automatically
selected. For external products such as FTDI USB Serial Cables, the
serial address may need to be copied manually. Additionally, the reset
button on the device may also need to be pressed before a connection
message appears. {% endhint %}

Connecting via Telnet
---------------------

After installing the Pymakr Plugin, a device may be connected via the
telnet interface. Please see the following steps:

1. Ensure that Pycom device is turned on
2. Connect the host computer to the WiFi Access Point named after your
   board (the SSID will be as follows e.g. ``lopy-wlan-xxxx``,
   ``wipy-wlan-xxxx``, etc.). The password is ``www.pycom.io``.
3. Follow the steps as above in the “Connecting via Serial USB” section
   but

   enter ``192.168.4.1`` as the address.

4. The default username and password are ``micro`` and ``python``,
   respectively.
5. Click ``Connect`` in the Pymakr pane, Pymakr will now connect via
   telnet.
