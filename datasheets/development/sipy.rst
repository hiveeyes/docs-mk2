(TX1/RX1), SPI (CLK, MOSI, MISO) and I2C (SDA, SCL) are defaults and can
be changed in Software. {% endhint %}

Notes
-----

WiFi
~~~~

By default, upon boot the SiPy will create a WiFi access point with the
SSID ``sipy-wlan-XXXX``, where ``XXXX`` is a random 4-digit number, and
the password ``www.pycom.io``.

Power
~~~~~

The ``Vin`` pin on the SiPy can be supplied with a voltage ranging from
``3.5v`` to ``5.5v``. The ``3.3v`` pin on the other hand is output
**only**, and must not be used to feed power into the SiPy, otherwise
the on-board regulator will be damaged.

Deep Sleep
~~~~~~~~~~

Due to a couple issues with the SiPy design the module draws more
current than it should while in deep sleep. The DC-DC switching
regulator always stays in high performance mode which is used to provide
the lowest possible output ripple when the modules is in use. In this
mode, it draws a quiescent current of 10mA. When the regulator is put
into ECO mode, the quiescent current goes down to 10uA. Unfortunately,
the pin used to control this mode is out of the RTC domain, and
therefore not usable during deep sleep. This causes the regulator to
always stay in PWM mode, keeping its quiescent current at 10mA.
Alongside this the flash chip doesn’t enter power down mode because the
CS pin is floating during deep sleep. This causes the flash chip to
consume around 2mA of current. To work around this issue a `“deep sleep
shield” <../boards/deepsleep/>`__ is available that attaches to the
module and allows power to be cut off from the device. The device can
then be re-enabled either on a timer or via pin interrupt. With the deep
sleep shield the current consumption during deep sleep is between 7uA
and 10uA depending on the wake sources configured.
