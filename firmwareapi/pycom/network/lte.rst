LTE
===

The LTE class provides access to the LTE-M/NB-IoT modem on the GPy and
FiPy. LTE-M/NB-IoT are new categories of cellular protocols developed by
the `3GPP <http://www.3gpp.org>`__ and optimised for long battery life
power and longer range. These are new protocols currently in the process
of being deployed by mobile networks across the world.

The GPy and FiPy support both new LTE-M protocols:

-  **Cat-M1**: also known as **LTE-M** defines a 1.4 MHz radio channel
   size and about 375 kbps of throughput. It is optimised for coverage
   and long battery life, outperforming 2G/GPRS, while being similar to
   previous LTE standards.
-  **Cat-NB1** also known as **NB-IoT**, defines a 200 kHz radio channel
   size and around 60 kbps of uplink speed. It’s optimised for ultra low
   throughput and specifically designed for IoT devices with a very long
   battery life. NB-IoT shares some features with LTE such as operating
   in licensed spectrum, but it’s a very different protocol. It should
   be noted that NB-IoT has many restrictions as does not offer full IP
   connectivity and does not support mobility. When moving between
   cells, you will need to reconnect.

{% hint style=“info” %} **Please note:** The GPy and FiPy only support
the two protocols above and are not compatible with older LTE standards.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style=“info” %} The Sequans modem used on Pycom’s cellular
enabled modules can only work in one of these modes at a time. In order
to switch between the two protocols you need to flash a different
firmware to the Sequans modem. Instructions for this can be found
`here <../../../tutorials/lte/firmware.md>`__. {% endhint %}

AT Commands
-----------

The AT commands for the Sequans Monarch modem on the GPy/FiPy are
available in a PDF file.

Constructors
------------

class network.LTE(id=0, …)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create and configure a LTE object. See init for params of configuration.

.. code:: python

   from network import LTE
   lte = LTE()

Methods
-------

lte.init(*, carrier=None)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This method is used to set up the LTE subsystem. After a ``deinit()``
this method can take several seconds to return waiting for the LTE modem
to start-up. Optionally specify a carrier name. The available options
are: ``verizon, at&t, standard``. ``standard`` is generic for any
carrier, and it’s also the option used when no arguments are given.

lte.deinit()
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Disables LTE modem completely. This reduces the power consumption to the
minimum. Call this before entering deepsleep.

lte.attach(*, band=None)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Enable radio functionality and attach to the LTE Cat M1 network
authorised by the inserted SIM card. Optionally specify the band to scan
for networks. If no band (or ``None``) is specified, all 6 bands will be
scanned. The possible values for the band are:
``3, 4, 12, 13, 20 and 28``.

lte.isattached()
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Returns ``True`` if the cellular mode is attached to the network.
``False`` otherwise.

lte.dettach()
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Detach the modem from the LTE Cat M1 and disable the radio
functionality.

lte.connect(*, cid=1)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Start a data session and obtain and IP address. Optionally specify a CID
(Connection ID) for the data session. The arguments are:

-  ``cid`` is a Connection ID. This is carrier specific, for Verizon use
   ``cid=3``. For others like Telstra it should be ``cid=1``.

For instance, to attach and connect to Verizon:

.. code:: python

   import time
   from network import LTE

   lte = LTE(carrier="verizon")
   lte.attach(band=13)

   while not lte.isattached():
       time.sleep(0.5)
       print('Attaching...')

   lte.connect(cid=3)
   while not lte.isconnected():
       time.sleep(0.5)
       print('Connecting...')

   # Now use sockets as usual...

lte.isconnected()
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Returns ``True`` if there is an active LTE data session and IP address
has been obtained. ``False`` otherwise.

lte.disconnect()
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

End the data session with the network.

lte.send_at_cmd(cmd)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Send an AT command directly to the modem. Returns the raw response from
the modem as a string object. **IMPORTANT:** If a data session is active
(i.e. the modem is *connected*), sending the AT commands requires to
pause and then resume the data session. This is all done automatically,
but makes the whole request take around 2.5 seconds.

Example:

.. code:: python

   lte.send_at_cmd('AT+CEREG?')    # check for network registration manually (sames as lte.isattached())

Optionally the response can be parsed for pretty printing:

.. code:: python

   def send_at_cmd_pretty(cmd):
       response = lte.send_at_cmd(cmd).split('\r\n')
       for line in response:
           print(line)

   send_at_cmd_pretty('AT!="showphy"')     # get the PHY status
   send_at_cmd_pretty('AT!="fsm"')         # get the System FSM

lte.imei()
^^^^^^^^^^

Returns a string object with the IMEI number of the LTE modem.

lte.iccid()
^^^^^^^^^^^

Returns a string object with the ICCID number of the SIM card.

lte.reset()
^^^^^^^^^^^

Perform a hardware reset on the cellular modem. This function can take
up to 5 seconds to return as it waits for the modem to shutdown and
reboot.
